# Printer
# Description
I think RF Code would be a really cool company to work with! They seem to value their people and take into account all different types of brains to help make all projects successful. This is a printer challenge that has a few requirements:
    -Multiple labels should print on one page (if possible)
    -Each page supports up to 1024 characters
    -The labels should print when the buffer is full
    -Print if the unprinted data becomes 10 seconds old
    -Must accept user input
    
I tend to go for the most complex solution initially, which is why my code contained a full MySQL database with seeded input and a server. As I was building out a whole site, I stopped, realized what I was doing, and decided to sleep on it. The practicality of this project should be rooted in MVP (minimum viable product), not because I don't value the challenge, but because this should just show that I know how to do simple coding. They don't want a full site that is ultimately useless! 

I know prompts are annoying, but they are a simple means of executing the user input requirement. Since the data will be entered to the console immediately upon hitting enter, the buffering and 10-second requirements should already be fulfilled. I am assuming that the console is one page, but any labels greater than 1024 characters will output a "new page" console.log. 

I may be putting forth too many assumptions, but ultimately this was my MVP.

# Usage
Download the files to your code editor of choice, then pop open the HTML file in your browser (preferably Chrome). I do this by right-clicking on the HTML file, then choosing the "Open in Default Browser" option. Once the page it up, right click on the web page and open your console by clicking "Inspect" and navigating to the "Console" tab. Follow the prompts to see your results printed.
